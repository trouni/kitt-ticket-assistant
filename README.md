# Kitt Ticket Assistant

Give Kitt a voice to minimize the risk of a ticket going unnoticed for too long.

### Why?

When working remotely, it's relatively easy to miss the Slack notification of a new ticket. Especially if you need to be away from your computer or phone for a moment. If you're like me, you end up constantly looking over that computer or phone screen to check whether or not that last Slack message was a ticket notification, or just a new meme.

The ticket assistant will help you stay chill about those Slack notifications, while making sure you don't miss out on the important ticket notifications, by asking you to confirm that you've seen the ticket.


### How does it work?

- The extension will play a gentle chime upon assignment of a new ticket (useful in case you wanted to have a distinct notification sound just for tickets, to be able to distinguish them from normal Slack messages).
- Simply click anywhere on the tickets page to confirm that you saw the ticket (this will dismiss the assistant).
- In the absence of confirmation from your end, Kitt will speak to you to notify you that a ticket needs your attention. It will repeat that message every 30 seconds until you dismiss the ticket assistant.
- Note: the assistant will not notify you if you are being assigned a ticket right after finishing one. Since you are already on the tickets page marking a ticket as completed, the assistant assumes that you've already seen that next one coming up, and will not bother you with a confirmation.

### Installation

1. Install the extension from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/kitt-ticket-assistant/gfjdbpckaoakgmfdnaijajlniihnlcal)
2. On the tickets page, activate the ticket assistant by clicking the icon next to the notification bell.
   
Note: in order to make the assistant less intrusive and to comply with the browser's autoplay policy, the ticket assistant should be enabled every time you load or refresh the tickets page.

You can now turn on the sound, and go away from your computer/phone to do anything else. The ticket assistant will make sure no students are kept waiting :)
